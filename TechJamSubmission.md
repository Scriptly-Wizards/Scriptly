# TechJam Submission

## Project Overview

**Project Name:**  Scriptly
**Team Name:** Scriptly Wizards
**Team Members:** [List of Team Members]

## Project Description

Our project is a recipe-style generator designed for TikTok users. Users input specific prompts, which we analyze and convert into inputs for our Generative AI (GenAI). The GenAI then creates a comprehensive shooting guide, including video scripts, shooting suggestions, music recommendations, and sample content for use.

## Features and Functionality

- **Feature 1:** Users can fill out a simple, intuitive form to provide details about their TikTok video ideas. The form captures key information such as the key words, video Type, tone and style, and any specific elements they want to include in their video. The system automatically analyzes the input from the form and generates a detailed video script. This script includes dialogue, scene descriptions, and a sequence of shots to guide users in creating their video.

## Development Tools

1. **IDE**: Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
   - **Description:** Used for writing and managing code with helpful features like syntax highlighting and debugging.

2. **Backend Framework**: Django
   - **Description:** Handles server-side logic and data management, making it easy to build the backend.

3. **Frontend Library**: React
   - **Description:** Creates the user interface, allowing for a dynamic and responsive experience.

4. **Version Control**: Git
   - **Description:** Manages code changes and collaboration, keeping track of the development history.

## APIs Used

The project integrates the following APIs:

- **1. [Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview/agents)**
